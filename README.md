👋 Hey there, I'm Clinton Ojo!

👩🏻‍💻 As a Software Engineer/Data Analytics enthusiast, I'm here to share my journey and insights in the dynamic world of tech.

👩🏻‍🎓 I'm a student of [Computer Science] at the National College of Ireland, where I'm delving deep into the core principles of computing.

🎨 Exciting things are brewing as I gear up to launch captivating videos on YouTube covering a myriad of topics including Computer Science, tech, Chess, and more.

💭 Currently immersing myself in Python and gearing up to explore the realms of front-end development and MySQL!

⚡ Fun fact: I'm not just a tech enthusiast, but also an avid chess player, leveraging strategic thinking both on and off the board!

🔭 Currently, I'm enhancing my Python skills through personal projects and tutorials, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the world of coding.
